<h2>Writings</h2>
<p>A selection of things I wrote for the Emerging Media & Communication program at the University of Texas at Dallas.</p>

<h3><a href="http://craftcvltvre.wordpress.com/">CraftCvltvre</a></h3>
<p>CraftCvltvre was a blog using dark aesthetic culture and style as a lens through which to explore the concepts of online niche communities, the creative process behind handcrafted objects, and the relationship between the material and the digital. This was my undergraduate capstone media project.</p>

<h3><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/106830493/contentanalysis.pdf">Haus of Gloi: A Content Analysis</a></h3>
<p>I wrote this paper for a Communications Research Methods course in the Spring 2013 semester. It examines the social media messaging employed by an independent brand of handmade goods as a marketing and public broadcasting tool. <b>(PDF)</b></p>

<h3><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/106830493/has_prologue/hasprologue.html">Hide & Seek</a></h3>
<p>This is a piece of nonlinear hypertext fiction I wrote for a class called Digital Textuality in the Spring 2013 semester. I created it with an interactive format and used mixed media (including Creative Commons media) to demonstrate the potential of digital storytelling. In addition, I handcoded all of the HTML and CSS.</p>
